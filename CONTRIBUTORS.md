## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Standards

**TypeScript/JavaScript:**
- **ESLint** configuration is provided - follow the rules
- **Naming**: Use `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for components
- **Comments**: Write clear, helpful comments for complex logic
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully

**React Components:**
```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface GameCardProps {
  title: string;
  playerCount: number;
  onJoin: () => void;
}

export const GameCard: React.FC = ({ title, playerCount, onJoin }) => {
  return (
    
      {title}
      {playerCount} players
      
        Join Game
      
    
  );
};
```

**Discord Bot Commands:**
```typescript
// ✅ Good
export const command: SlashCommand = {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName('trivia')
    .setDescription('Start a trivia game'),
  
  async execute(client: ExtendedClient, interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction) {
    try {
      // Game logic here
      await interaction.reply('🧠 Trivia game started!');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Trivia command error:', error);
      await interaction.reply({ 
        content: '❌ Failed to start trivia game!', 
        ephemeral: true 
      });
    }
  }
};
```

**API Endpoints:**
```typescript
// ✅ Good
app.post('/api/games/:gameId/join', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { gameId } = req.params;
    const { userId } = req.body;
    
    // Validation
    if (!userId) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'userId is required' });
    }
    
    // Business logic
    const result = await gameService.joinGame(gameId, userId);
    
    // Success response
    res.json({ success: true, data: result });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Join game error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});
```

## 🏗️ Project Structure & Isolation System

### 📂 Understanding Our Modular Architecture

Arkadia uses a **complete isolation system** to ensure contributors never conflict with each other's work. Each game is a self-contained module across all packages.

### 🎮 Game Module Structure

**Every new game follows this isolated pattern:**

```
Arkadia/
├── packages/
│   ├── frontend/src/games/
│   │   ├── trivia/           # Trivia game (complete isolation)
│   │   ├── tic-tac-toe/      # Tic-tac-toe game (complete isolation)
│   │   ├── your-new-game/    # Your game goes here
│   │   └── template/         # Copy this to start new games
│   ├── backend/src/games/
│   │   ├── trivia/           # Trivia API endpoints
│   │   ├── tic-tac-toe/      # Tic-tac-toe API endpoints  
│   │   ├── your-new-game/    # Your API endpoints go here
│   │   └── template/         # Copy this to start new games
│   └── bot/src/games/
│       ├── trivia/           # Trivia Discord commands
│       ├── tic-tac-toe/      # Tic-tac-toe Discord commands
│       ├── your-new-game/    # Your Discord commands go here
│       └── template/         # Copy this to start new games
```

### 🛡️ Zero Conflict Development

**✅ What This Means for You:**
- **Work independently** - Your game folder is completely yours
- **No merge conflicts** - You'll never touch another contributor's game code
- **Safe experimentation** - Break your own game without affecting others
- **Easy collaboration** - Multiple people can work on different games simultaneously

### 🔧 Adding a New Game - Step by Step

**1. Choose Your Game Name**
```bash
# Use kebab-case for consistency
# ✅ Good: word-chain, racing-game, memory-match
# ❌ Bad: WordChain, racing_game, Memory Match
```

**2. Copy Template to All Packages**
```bash
# Frontend component
cp -r packages/frontend/src/games/template packages/frontend/src/games/your-game-name

# Backend API
cp -r packages/backend/src/games/template packages/backend/src/games/your-game-name

# Discord bot commands  
cp -r packages/bot/src/games/template packages/bot/src/games/your-game-name
```

**3. Automatic Registration**
Once you create your game folders, they're automatically:
- **API Routes**: Available at `/api/games/your-game-name/*`
- **Frontend Routes**: Available at `/games/your-game-name`
- **Discord Commands**: Available as `/your-game-name *`
- **WebSocket Namespace**: Available at `/your-game-name`

### 📋 Individual Game Structure

**Each game module contains:**

```
your-game-name/
├── frontend/src/games/your-game-name/
│   ├── components/           # React components for your game
│   ├── hooks/               # Custom hooks for game logic
│   ├── pages/               # Game pages and routes
│   ├── services/            # API calls specific to your game
│   └── types.ts             # TypeScript types for your game
├── backend/src/games/your-game-name/
│   ├── routes.ts            # Your API endpoints
│   ├── models.ts            # Database models for your game
│   ├── services.ts          # Business logic for your game
│   ├── websockets.ts        # Real-time features for your game
│   └── utils.ts             # Utility functions for your game
└── bot/src/games/your-game-name/
    ├── commands/            # Discord slash commands
    ├── events/              # Discord event handlers
    ├── utils.ts             # Bot utility functions
    └── types.ts             # Bot-specific types
```

### 🚀 Development Workflow

**Starting a New Game:**
1. **Pick an issue** labeled with `new-game` or `game-development`
2. **Copy the template** for all three packages
3. **Rename everything** from "template" to your game name
4. **Start coding** - you own this entire module!
5. **Test independently** - your game won't affect others

**Working on Existing Games:**
1. **Find game-specific issues** labeled with the game name
2. **Navigate to that game's folder** only
3. **Make your changes** within that isolated module
4. **Test your specific game** without worrying about others

### 🔒 Isolation Benefits

**🛡️ For Contributors:**
- **No accidental conflicts** with other contributors
- **Safe to experiment** and make mistakes
- **Focus on your game** without understanding the entire codebase
- **Easy testing** - only your game is affected by changes

**🏗️ For the Project:**
- **Parallel development** - multiple games can be developed simultaneously
- **Modular codebase** - easier to maintain and debug
- **Scalable architecture** - can support unlimited games
- **Clean separation** - each game is a complete feature

### ⚠️ Important Rules

**✅ DO:**
- Work only in your assigned game folder
- Copy the template for new games
- Follow the naming conventions
- Test your game thoroughly
- Update your game's documentation

**❌ DON'T:**
- Modify other contributors' game folders
- Change core system files without discussion
- Break the naming conventions
- Add dependencies that affect other games
- Touch the template folder (it's for copying only)

### 🔍 Finding Your Way Around

**If you're working on the "racing" game:**
```bash
# Your files are ONLY in these locations:
packages/frontend/src/games/racing/
packages/backend/src/games/racing/
packages/bot/src/games/racing/

# You can safely ignore everything else!
```

**If you're working on "trivia" improvements:**
```bash
# Your files are ONLY in these locations:
packages/frontend/src/games/trivia/
packages/backend/src/games/trivia/
packages/bot/src/games/trivia/

# Other games don't affect you at all!
```

### 🎯 Quick Reference
